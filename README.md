# workplace_optimization
This app is an attempt at optimization of collaborations at work places and in projects involving labs and specified rooms. 
This is achived by indicating the presence of people currently in the room and all the recent activity that has took place in the room , 
and also the information about the members of the workplace .
This helps in collaborating with people since thier presence is known at all times, also people can catch up with what has been going on in the work place.
The final attribute is the info about the members which includes details such as phone number ,  skills , and some other personal details which will help people find out who can help them out in case of they get stuck in the project and require special insights from people of specific domains.
